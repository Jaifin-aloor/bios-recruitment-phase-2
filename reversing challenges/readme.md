## CHALLENGE 1 
### In this challenge i had to find out the hidden flag from the binary. So first i disassembled the executable with IDA and figured out there was a key but when i disassembled using binary ninja cloud i figured out that the key had to be reverse xored so i did that and got the flag.


## CHALLENGE 2
### In this challenge i had to figure out the flag from the .pyc file. A .pyc file is the file generated by the python interpreter when the python file is imported or executed. so i used an online python decompiler to decompile the .pyc file. i checked the decompiled file and i got the flag.



## CHALLENGE 3
### In this challenge i had to find the password so i first disassembled the file using IDA and then i used binary ninja cloud and in i read the file in HLIL format and it showed that if the password given is the decimal of a hexadecimal number then i would recive the flag. so i gave the decimal number as a parameter and i got the flag.

## CHALLENGE 4
### In this challenge i had to figure out the password in order to get the flag. so i disassembled it with binary ninja cloud and in the decompiled code it said if the parameter given is 10 characters long and if the 5th character is '@' then you get the flag. so i gave a password and got he flag.
