## CHALLENGE 1 


## CHALLENGE 2
### In this challenge i had to figure out the flag from the .pyc file. A .pyc file is the file generated by the python interpreter when the python file is imported or executed. so i used an online python decompiler to decompile the .pyc file. i checked the decompiled file and i got the flag.



## CHALLENGE 3
### In this challenge i had to find the password so i first dissasembled the file using IDA and then i used binary ninja cloud and in i read the file in HLIL format and it showed that if the password given is the decimal of a hexadecimal number then i would recive the flag. so i gave the decimal number and i got the flag.
